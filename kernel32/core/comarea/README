COMAREA - KERNEL<->Application Communication Interface
------------------------------------------------------

COMAREA, the term comes from, "Communication Area".
The basic idea of COMAREA was to decrease the amount
of systemcalls there'll be from applications.
This method aims into increaing the system performance
by not locking up the system which could be caused by
the overheat of systemcalls.

The basic functions of COMAREA are:
- Receiving data from the application
- Sending data to the application

COMAREA usually resides below the application stack,
and above the application's code.
See following description:

[ APPLICATION STACK ]

    [ COMAREA ]

[ APPLICATION CODE ]

One of the hardest jobs COMAREA has to do is
the translation of application's memory space
into the global address space.
Without doing this, COMAREA system couldn't
really access the application's COMAREA in
any way.
