			JTMOS HEART

misc = miscellaneous, mostly low level functions,
	+ kernel32.c (MAIN KERNEL FILE, AKA START UP / INIT / CLOSE)
Besides this is the heart of the JTMOS, the ../init/ dir will still
contain the init code for the OS and ../init/hwdet.c the hardware
detection code.


- For threads see:

iodma/
threads/ (aka process/)

( llint.asm, threads.c )
