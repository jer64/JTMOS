KINIT: JTMOS PROCESS LAUNCHER/CREATOR PROCESS
---------------------------------------------

init/keropt.c contains options concerning
default amount of RAM allocated per application.

07/2003: Added unique PID support.
09/2003: Unique ID support was disabled, since
it didn't work quite the way it was designed.
Now for a few months a different kind of PID
rolling mechanism is working, that ensures
that recently terminated process ID won't be
reused too quickly.

Although there still might be some reasons to
improve further this PID rolling mechanism.
One idea would be to increase the total amount
of max. processes from 256 to 512 or 1024.

This issue is considered "TODO".
