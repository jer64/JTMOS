THREADS: RUN APPLICATION

RunApplication description:
A) Define memory space on APPLICATION -structure
B) Map memory space on GDT
C) Create stack and thread
D) Identify thread

Conditions on C:

* IF APPLICATION THREAD: 
On application thread's case the stack must be defined 
with the virtual memory space's own addresses.

* IF KERNEL THREAD: 
On kernel thread's case the stack must be allocated
with kernel's own malloc. Kernel threads do not have
own seperate memory space, they all share common
memory space, this maybe a security risk,
but makes kernel/drivers run much faster,
and simplifies the making of kernel.
However, f.e. drivers are considered "applications",
and will be running at their own virtual memory spaces.
