"In order to avoid interference between scancode sequences or
mouse packets and the reponses given to commands, the 
keyboard or mouse should always be disabled before giving
a command that requires a response, and probably enabled 
afterwards. Some keyboards or mice do the disable automatically
in this situation, but still require an explicit enable 
afterwards."
