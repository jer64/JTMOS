		SLIP STACK
		----------

SLIP stands for Serial Line Internet Protocol,
it is used for very primitive and simple
internet connections. SLIP protocol was easy
to implement and work on, this is why it was
chosen for the JTMOS project too.

Making a PPP stack would've been considerably
more complex thing to do.

The current SLIP stack ...

- Uses configuration from configuration
file "slip.cfg", there is settings for
which serial port to use, and
at which BPS to use the serial port at.

- Contains queues for RECEIVED PACKETS
and TRANSMITTABLE PACKETS.

- Registers itself as "slip" device

- Contains device interface,
accepts RAW packet receive/transmit
functions
