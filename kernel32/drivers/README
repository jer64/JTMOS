	DRIVERS: JTMOS DRIVER SYSTEM
	============================

(C) 2003,2017 by Jari Tuominen (jari.t.tuominen@gmail.com)

NEW:
DEVSYS and DEVAPI have been integrated into the drivers folder.
Calls are working now with driver_ -heading.
Naming should be now thus more meaningful.

Devices can be accessed:
- by directly calling service function
(devcall)
- by making a remote call to service based
device driver

Although all this is done automatically
by devcall, so the caller of device functions
will not notice difference, excep that remote
devices are abit slower, but more reliable,
because these won't use kernel memory map,
but instead an application memory map.
