Currently we are handling the filesystem inside a diskimage,
so its not really running on top of some other device based storage,
but instead in directly accessable memory region, allocated with malloc.
In our vision, the ramdisk block device should not be the only
block device that is allowed to be used with the JTMFS and JTMFAT.


Implemention

	RAMDISK BLOCK DEVICE <-> JTMOS FILE SYSTEM <-> JTMOS FAT

Vision:

	The ramdisk block device will be configured as /dev/ramdisk
	the root (/) filesystem will be using the JTMOS File System(JTMFS).

Other supported file systems

	MSDOS FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 support would be preferred,
	but we'll see if there'll be a demand enough for it
	to make it right now, but in future, surely there will
	be support for it, but also support for other file systems.
