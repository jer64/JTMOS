Simulated JTMOS Kernel
======================

(C) 2008 by Jari Tuominen (jari.t.tuominen@gmail.com).

This subproject of JTMOS aims to create testing a platform of
all key modules included in the JTMOS kernel.

ACCELERATION OF DEVELOPMENT

The purpose of this project is to accelerate development of the key modules
of the JTMOS kernel by developing those outside the JTMOS Host Operating System,
thus enabling the development of the kernel outside itself.

HOST OPERATING SYSTEMS

Currently the only testing host operating system supported is Debian Etch Linux,
others may or may not work.

PRIORITIES

First priority is to make the JTMOS File System (JTMFS) function with it.

SIMULATED DEVAPI

A simulated DEVAPI will provide access to a simulated ramdisk and
a simulated hard disk drive that resides in a single file.
