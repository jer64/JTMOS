		JTMOS LIBC
		==========

This is the source code directory of JTMOS LIBC.

Many dummy functions are featured,
that mostly don't do anything but return NULL or 0.
^^^^^^^^^^^TODO^^^^^^^^^^^

JTMOS LIBC attempts to emulate MSDOS & DJGPP & Turbo C
environment, this features conio functions.
Also some Win32 emulation might be likely
to be featured in future. Also UNIX support is emphasized.

JTMOS defaults to:
#define MSDOS
#define DJGPP

MSDOS C programs usually get ported easiest, as UNIX C
programs which use open/close, etc. UNIX functions might
probably not work at all.
That will be fixed eventually when the JTMOS FS gets better.
