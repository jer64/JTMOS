<mImz> ermm
<mImz> well and where is the prob?
*** Mode change "-b *!*@*.inetia.pl" on channel #Linux by DDB

> ^^ that doesn't work
<mImz> well maybe it should look like this :
<gimbo> you need to typedef struct TROLL_T { long pie; TROLL_T 
*next_troll;
+TROLL_T *prev_troll;} TROLL;
<mImz> typedef struct troll TROLL;
<gimbo> uhm, struct TROLL_T in there even
<gimbo> coz at the point you use the first TROLL TROLL ain't a type
<gimbo> or a struct, coz it's an anonymous struct at that point
<aferist> I'm having sound problems can anyone help?
<mImz> =] smart
