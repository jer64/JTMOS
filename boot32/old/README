		JTMOS SYSTEM LOADER

Here is the system loader for JTMOS operating system.
It loads a 512K image from disk, sets up protected mode
and jumps to the 32-bit kernel image start, address 0x10000.
The boot loader itself is located at 0x7c00, where BIOS
loads the bootstrap loader.

              Originally I learned alot from:
              Example code of Protected Mode Tutorial
              which was written by Till Gerken(most useful).

              Later I modified and created it as
              boot sector image by Jari Tuominen.

      Thank you for your interest.
