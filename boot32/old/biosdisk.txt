      INT 13,8 - Get Current Drive Parameters (XT & newer)

AH = 08
DL = drive number (0=A:, 1=2nd floppy, 80h=drive 0, 81h=drive 1)


on return:
AH = status  (see INT 13,STATUS)
BL = CMOS drive type
     01 - 5.  360K           03 - 3.  720K
     02 - 5.  1.2Mb          04 - 3. 1.44Mb
CH = cylinders (0-1023 dec. see below)
CL = sectors per track  (see below)
DH = number of sides (0 based)
DL = number of drives attached
ES:DI = pointer to 11 byte Disk Base Table (DBT)
CF = 0 if successful
   = 1 if error

Cylinder and Sectors Per Track Format

.F.E.D.C.B.A.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.0.  CX
 . . . . . . . . . . .............  sectors per track
 . . . . . . . . .............  high order 2 bits of cylinder count
 .........................  low order 8 bits of cylinder count

- the track/cylinder number is a 10 bit value taken from the 2 high
  order bits of CL and the 8 bits in CH (low order 8 bits of track)
- many good programming references indicate this function is only
  available on the AT, PS/2 and later systems, but all hard disk
  systems since the XT have this function available
- only the disk number is checked for validity
