		JTMOS SYSTEM LOADER
		-------------------

Here is the system loader for JTMOS operating system.
It loads a 512K image from disk, sets up protected mode
and jumps to the 32-bit kernel image start, address 0x10000.
The boot loader itself is located at 0x7C00, where BIOS
loads the bootstrap loader.

New 2003/9: Added support for IDE hard disks.
JTMFS gone through a markable change which allowed it
to support kernel images placed inside a file system
and also a boot sector that hasn't been
supported before.

	Originally I learned alot from:
	Example code of Protected Mode Tutorial
	which was written by Till Gerken(most useful).

	The hard disk loader part was entirely
	done by me, by using HelpPC specifications,
	and so on.

	Later I modified and created it as
	boot sector image by Jari Tuominen.

	Thank you for your interest.
