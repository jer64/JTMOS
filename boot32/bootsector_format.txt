2. The Boot Sector
The boot sector exists at sector 0 on the disk and contains the basic disk geometry, which is the set of
information needed by the operating system to use the disk correctly. Whenever the disk is used, the
information from the boot sector is read and any needed information is extracted from it. The boot
sector on a DOS formatted floppy is a sequence of bytes that looks as follows:
