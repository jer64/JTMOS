	JTMOS DOES NOT WORK YET.
	CURRENT RELEASE IS:
	UNSTABLE, PRE-ALPHA.

	JTMOS consists of over 100,000
	lines of C code. It is hard to
	maintain, debug - making it stable
	will take estimately from one year
	to many years still.

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to The JTMOS, we aim to create a fully functional, flexible,
UN*X alike operating system, that can execute simple tasks, binary
executables, scripts, etc. It will support some basic hardware, like f.e.
standard PC keyboard, VGA graphics adapter,
sound(Sound Blaster), mouse(PS/2), FDC floppy disk drives and IDE HDs.
JTMOS might not be yet very much an operating system, but it is understable,
since we are still in quite the beginning, but however, we have achieved many
things we never couldn't even have dreamed of at the time of when we had
began in this project. We look with alot of hope and braveness at the future.

Currently dynamic kernel memory allocation system(KDMAS) is alittle inefficient,
therefore it also slows down many parts of the system that relies on it.
Some TODOs:
- Optimize file system.
- Optimize remote device driver access.
- Try not to write code which frequently requires KDMAS's services.
- Make multiple file operations possible to be done at once, instead
of doing one queued work at once only.

Internet features are being improved, e.g. slip works.
Read file 'INSTALL' -for a start up guide.

Note: Much of the documentation is outdated because the project evolves
way faster than the documentation.
